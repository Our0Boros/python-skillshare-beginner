## Files 

#### Open function
- In order to do any work with a file we first need to open it to access it
- The open function need just one argument (the file name) to open it
- The open fiunction returns an object representing the file (file_object)
- Python looks for the file in the same directory it's being stored
  - so we need to make sure that all our programs and text files are in the same directory

#### with keyword
- The python keyword with in front of the open function closes the file once access to it is no longer required
